 * This interface defines a way of extracting a compaction key from an object which

 * In most cases, for each compacted event type exactly one such object will be made known to the producer, and
 * you can define it using {@link #of(String, Class, Function)}, passing a method reference or a lambda.
 * For special occasions (e.g. where objects of different classes are used as payloads for the same event type)
 * also multiple extractors for the same event type are supported â€“ in this case any which returns a
 * non-empty optional will be used.
